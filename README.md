A custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration to control
**[Axium](https://www.axiumcontrol.com/)** multi-zone amplifiers over Ethernet
using the official Axium Communications Protocol.

Each amplifier zone is exposed as a `media_player` entity, giving you power,
volume, mute and source-selection control. The integration keeps a persistent
TCP connection open and listens for the notifications the amplifier emits when
its state changes, so Home Assistant stays in sync even when zones are changed
from a keypad or the front panel (a `local_push` integration — no polling).

> The full protocol specification is included in this repository:
> [`AxiumCommsProtocol.pdf`](AxiumCommsProtocol.pdf).

## Features

- 🏷️ Named zones (e.g. *Kitchen*, *Living room*), each its own device
- 🧩 User-defined **zone groups** to control several zones as one
- 🔎 Automatic **model and firmware detection** — no need to pick your amp
- 🔌 Power on/off per zone (command `0x01`)
- 🔇 Mute / unmute (command `0x02`)
- 🔊 Volume set and step up/down (commands `0x04`, `0x11`, `0x12`)
- 🎚️ Source selection, S1–S16 (command `0x03`)
- 📡 Live state updates pushed from the amplifier (notifications)
- ♻️ Automatic reconnection with backoff

## Requirements

- An Ethernet-equipped Axium amplifier (e.g. AX-400-X, AX-800-X, AX-1250,
  AX-Mini series) reachable on your network.
- The amplifier listens for the protocol on **TCP port 17037**.
- Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or newer.

You can verify connectivity before installing by opening a telnet session to the
amplifier on port 17037 (the protocol explicitly supports this for testing), or
by running the bundled [probe script](#testing-with-the-probe-script).

## Testing with the probe script

[`scripts/probe.py`](scripts/probe.py) is a standalone, dependency-free tool
(Python 3.9+ stdlib only) you can run from any PC on the same network to confirm
the amplifier responds and to inspect the raw protocol framing — handy before
installing the integration.

```bash
python scripts/probe.py 192.168.1.50
```

It connects, asks the amplifier to identify itself, requests its zone
assignments, then prints every frame it receives — both the raw ASCII-hex and a
decoded interpretation:

```
>> sent  14 FF 03                 Request Device information
<< recv  94 00 00 02 8A 00 07     Response: Device information  zone=0 (zone 96)
        device=Amplifier  model=AX-1250  fw=v2  unit_id=0x0007
<< recv  01 0B 01                 Standby / Power  zone=11  ->  A Power On
<< recv  04 0B 50                 Volume  zone=11  ->  50% (v1=0x50)
```

Options:

- `--port 17037` – override the TCP port.
- `--duration 15` – how long to listen for frames (default 10s).
- `--send 38FF` – send an extra raw command as hex (repeatable), e.g. request a
  zone name.

If you see no frames, it is either not an Axium amplifier, does not answer the
identify command, or a firewall is blocking the reply.

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. In HACS, go to **Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/t-joosten/hass-axium` with category **Integration**.
3. Search for **Axium Amplifier** and install it.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/axium` folder into your Home Assistant
   `config/custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **Axium Amplifier**.
3. Enter:
   - **Host** – the amplifier's IP address or hostname.
   - **Port** – defaults to `17037`.
   - **Name** – a friendly name for the amplifier.
   - **Zones** – a comma-separated list of zones as `number=Name`, for example
     `1=Kitchen, 2=Living room, 3=Bedroom`. The name is optional (defaults to
     `Zone N`), and zone numbers may be any value the amplifier uses (0–95).

During setup the integration verifies that an **actual Axium amplifier
responds** at the address (it sends a *Request Device information* command and
waits for the reply), so you get a clear error instead of a silent failure:

- **Failed to connect** – nothing accepted the connection (wrong host/port, or
  the amplifier is offline).
- **No Axium amplifier responded** – something answered on the port, but it was
  not an Axium amplifier (or it did not reply in time).

Each zone becomes its own `media_player` device named after the room, nested
under the amplifier device. Zones are always created, so they are available as
soon as the amplifier connects.

### Naming and editing zones

Use the integration's **Configure** dialog → **Edit zones and names** to rename
zones or change which zones exist at any time.

### Zone groups

A zone group is a single `media_player` that controls several zones together —
power, volume, mute and source are applied to every member zone. You can create
as many groups as you like.

In the **Configure** dialog:

- **Add a zone group** – give the group a name (e.g. `Downstairs`) and tick the
  zones it should control.
- **Remove a zone group** – delete groups you no longer need.

A group reports an aggregated state: it is *on* if any member is on, shows the
average member volume, is *muted* only when every member is muted, and shows a
source only when all members agree. The member zone numbers are exposed in the
`zones` attribute.

Remember to choose **Save and finish** in the menu to apply your changes.

### Sources

Sources are exposed as `Source 1` … `Source 8` and map to the amplifier's
physical inputs S1–S16. Selecting a source also powers the zone on. You can
rename sources from the Home Assistant entity settings.

### Amplifier model & firmware

You do **not** select your amplifier model during setup. On connection the
integration sends a *Request Device information* command (`0x14`) and reads the
amplifier's reply, which reports the device type, model code and firmware
version. The amplifier (hub) device in Home Assistant is then updated
automatically with the detected **model** (e.g. *AX-800-X*, *AX-1250*,
*AX-400-X*, *AX-Mini1*) and **firmware** version.

If the amplifier does not respond to the query, control still works and the
device simply remains labelled generically as *Amplifier*.

## How it works

Commands use the frame format `<command><zone>[<data>...]`. Every byte is sent
as two ASCII-hex characters, terminated by a line feed. For example, *power on
zone 1* is the bytes `01 01 01`, transmitted as:

```
010101\n
```

Volume (`0x04`) uses a `v1` byte spanning `0x00`–`0xA0` (0–160), an 80 dB range
in 0.5 dB steps, which the integration maps onto Home Assistant's `0.0`–`1.0`
volume level. The amplifier re-uses the same command bytes as notifications, so
the integration updates entity state directly from those messages.
